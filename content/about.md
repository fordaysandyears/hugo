## About _For Days and Years_

_“For Days and Years”_ is a digital devotional inspired by the 1879 book by H. L. Sidney Lear:  
**A Book Containing a Text, Short Reading and Hymn for Every Day in the Church's Year**.

This site offers a quiet space for reflection and reading, structured around the traditional Christian calendar. Each entry corresponds to a day in the liturgical year, preserving the tone and rhythm of the original work.

The original was published in New York by E. P. Dutton, 1879.

This project is a labor of love — part preservation, part prayerbook.


Best viewed using e-ink (What isn't?) or on the command line or Emacs or something textually. 


As a cheat you can do something like hg/days/2025-01-04/ to skip about the pages. As most of this project is manual entry most of the dates are empty so far.

I think this will eventually become a simple phone app that displays a day by day calendar and that is all. No settings, no distrations, just a full screen Calendar type thing.
