“For Days and Years” is a digital devotional inspired by the 1879 book by H. L. Sidney Lear.\
_A Book Containing a Text, Short Reading and Hymn for Every Day in the Church's Year_.

This site offers a quiet space for reflection and reading, structured around the traditional Christian calendar.\
Each entry corresponds to a day in the liturgical year, preserving the tone and rhythm of the original work.

**The original was published in New York by E. P. Dutton, 1879**.


Best viewed using e-ink (What isn't?) or on the command line or Emacs or something textually. 

As a cheat you can do something like /days/2025-01-04/ to skip about the pages. As most of this project is manual entry most of the dates are empty so far.

I think this will eventually become a simple phone app that displays a day by day calendar and that is all. No settings, no distrations, just a full screen Calendar type thing.
