### Collect

**O God**, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed: Give unto Thy servants that peace which the world cannot give, that our hearts may be set to obey Thy commandments, and also that we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Savior, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. **Amen**.
