### Collect

**O Lord Jesus Christ**, the true Paschal Lamb, who by Thy sacrifice hast taken away the sins of the world: Grant that we who celebrate Thy resurrection may be continually renewed by Thy Spirit and walk in the light of Thy presence; who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. **Amen**.


### Psalm 102:1-17

Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my crying come unto thee&#x2026; `*`
