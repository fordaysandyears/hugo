### Collect

**O Lord**, from whom all good things do come: Grant to us Thy humble servants, that by Thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by Thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen**.
