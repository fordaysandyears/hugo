### Collect

**O Lord**, we beseech thee, give ear to our prayers, and by thy gracious visitation lighten the darkness of our hearts; by thy mercy, O Lord our God, who livest and reignest with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. **Amen**.


### Psalm: 25:1-10

"Unto thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul&#x2026; All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant. `*`
