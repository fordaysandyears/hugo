### Collect

**O Almighty God**, who hast knit together Thine elect in one communion and fellowship, in the mystical body of Thy Son Christ our Lord: Grant us grace so to follow Thy blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living, that we may come to those unspeakable joys which Thou hast prepared for them that unfeignedly love Thee; through the same **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
