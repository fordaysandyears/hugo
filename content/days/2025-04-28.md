### Collect

**O Lord Jesus Christ**, who after thy resurrection didst appear to thine apostles and didst breathe on them thy Holy Spirit: Grant unto us, we beseech thee, such a measure of thy Spirit that we may live in the power of thy endless life; who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.
