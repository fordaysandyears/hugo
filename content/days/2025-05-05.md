### Collect

**Almighty and everlasting God**, who in the Paschal mystery hast established the new covenant of reconciliation: Grant that all who are reborn into the fellowship of Christâ€™s Body may show forth in their lives what they profess by their faith; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen**.
