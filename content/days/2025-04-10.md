### Collect

**O God**, whose Son Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life: Raise us, we beseech thee, from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, that we may seek those things which are above, where he sitteth at thy right hand in glory; through the same thy Son **Jesus Christ our Lord**.
