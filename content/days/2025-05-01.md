### Collect

**Almighty God**, who through Thine only-begotten Son Jesus Christ hast overcome death and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life: We humbly beseech Thee that, as by Thy special grace Thou dost put into our minds good desires, so by Thy continual help we may bring the same to good effect; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. **Amen**.


### Epistle: 1 John 3:1-7

See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God&#x2026;
