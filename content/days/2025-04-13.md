### Collect

**Almighty and everlasting God**, who in the Paschal mystery hast established the new covenant of reconciliation: Grant that all who have been reborn into the fellowship of Christâ€™s Body may show forth in their lives what they profess by their faith; through the same **Jesus Christ our Lord**.
