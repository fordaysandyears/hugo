### Collect

**O God**, the light of the hearts that see Thee, the life of the souls that love Thee, and the strength of the thoughts that seek Thee: Help us so to know Thee that we may truly love Thee, and so to love Thee that we may fully serve Thee, whom to serve is perfect freedom; through **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
