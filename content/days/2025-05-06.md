### Collect

**O God**, the King of glory, who hast exalted Thine only Son Jesus Christ with great triumph unto Thy kingdom in heaven: We beseech Thee, leave us not comfortless, but send to us Thine Holy Spirit to strengthen us, and exalt us to the same place whither our Savior Christ is gone before; who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the same Spirit, one God, world without end. **Amen**.
