### Collect

**Almighty and merciful God**, of whose only gift it cometh that Thy faithful people do unto Thee true and laudable service: Grant, we beseech Thee, that we may so faithfully serve Thee in this life, that we fail not finally to attain Thy heavenly promises; through the merits of **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
