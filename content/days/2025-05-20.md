### Collect

**O God**, the giver of all good gifts, who of Thy divine providence hast appointed divers Orders in Thy Church: Give Thy grace, we humbly beseech Thee, to all those who are called to any office and administration amongst Thy people; that they may serve Thee in this life, and in the world to come may attain everlasting glory; through **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
