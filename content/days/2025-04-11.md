### Collect

**Almighty God**, who hast given thine only Son to be unto us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of godly life: Give us grace that we may always most thankfully receive his inestimable benefits, and also daily endeavor ourselves to follow the blessed steps of his most holy life; through the same **Jesus Christ our Lord**.
