### Ephesians V.14.

Arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.


### reading

Arise and Work While It Is Day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work, says our Saviour Himself. Happy are they who rise early in the morning of their youth; for the day of life is very short, and the act of Christianity long and difficult. Is it not a grievous thing that men consider not why they come into the world till they be upon the point of going out again, nor think how to live till they be summoned to die? But most of all unhappy he who never wakens out of that dream of false happiness till he fall into eternal misery. Arise then betimes, and prevent that sad awakening.
`Archbishop Leighton`.


### Hymn

Christ, Whose glory fills the skies,
Christ the true, the only Light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Triumph o&rsquo;er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee,
Joyless is the day&rsquo;s return
Till Thy mercy&rsquo;s beams I see,
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warn my heart.
`Charles Wesley`.
