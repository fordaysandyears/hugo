### Collect

**O God**, whose never-failing providence ordereth all things both in heaven and earth: We humbly beseech Thee to put away from us all hurtful things, and to give us those things which are profitable for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. **Amen**.
