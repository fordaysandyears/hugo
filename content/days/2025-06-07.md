### Collect

**O God**, the strength of all those who put their trust in thee: Mercifully accept our prayers; and because, through the weakness of our mortal nature, we can do no good thing without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping of thy commandments we may please thee, both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. **Amen**.


### Hymn

Come, Thou Almighty King, help us Thy name to sing; help us to praise: Father, all glorious, o&rsquo;er all victorious, come, and reign over us, Ancient of Days. `*`
