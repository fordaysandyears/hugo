### Collect

**O God**, who showest to them that be in error the light of Thy truth, to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness: Grant unto all those who are admitted into the fellowship of Christâ€™s religion, that they may forsake those things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all such things as are agreeable to the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. **Amen**.
