### Collect

**Almighty God**, who showest to them that are in error the light of thy truth, to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness: Grant unto all those who are admitted into the fellowship of Christâ€™s religion, that they may avoid those things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all such things as are agreeable to the same; through our **Lord Jesus Christ**.
