### Collect

**Almighty God**, who showest to them that are in error the light of thy truth, to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness: Grant unto all those who are admitted into the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s religion, that they may avoid those things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all such things as are agreeable to the same; through our **Lord Jesus Christ**.


### Colossians 1:13-14 KJV

Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
