### Hymn

Christ, Whose glory fills the skies,
Christ the true, the only Light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Triumph o&rsquo;er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee,
Joyless is the day&rsquo;s return
Till Thy mercy&rsquo;s beams I see,
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warn my heart.
`Charles Wesley`.
