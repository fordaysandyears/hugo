### Collect

**Almighty God**, who through thine only-begotten Son Jesus Christ hast overcome death and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life: Grant that we, who celebrate with joy the day of the Lordâ€™s resurrection, may be raised from the death of sin by thy life-giving Spirit; through the same **Jesus Christ our Lord**.
