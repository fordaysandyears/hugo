### Collect

**O God**, the Creator of all things, who by Thy Son Jesus Christ didst make known Thy will unto the world: Illuminate our minds, we beseech Thee, with the light of Thy truth, that we may discern Thy purpose for our lives and walk in the way of Thy commandments; through the same **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
