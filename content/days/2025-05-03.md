### Collect

Grant, we beseech Thee, Almighty God, that we who have celebrated the Paschal feast may, by the help of Thy grace, bring forth the fruits thereof in our lives and conduct; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. **Amen**.
