### Collect

**O God**, whose Son Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life: Raise us, we beseech thee, from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, that we may seek those things which are above, where he sitteth at thy right hand in glory; through the same thy Son **Jesus Christ our Lord**.


### Romans 10 9,10 KJV

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the **Lord Jesus**, and shalt believe in thine heart that **God** hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.


### Reading

As He is risen, so now He dieth not.
