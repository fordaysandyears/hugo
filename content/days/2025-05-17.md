### Collect

**O God**, the King of saints, we praise and magnify Thy holy Name for all Thy servants who have finished their course in Thy faith and fear: Grant us grace to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers of Thy heavenly kingdom; through **Jesus Christ our Lord**. **Amen**.
