#### THE GOSPEL.  S. John 18. 33. {#the-gospel-dot-s-dot-john-18-dot-33-dot}

THEN Pilate entered into the judgement-hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?  Thine own nation and the chidf priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then?  Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king: to this end was I born and came into the world, that I should witness to the truth: every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?

#### Romans 10 9,10 KJV {#romans-10-9-10-kjv}

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the **Lord Jesus**, and shalt believe in thine heart that **God** hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
