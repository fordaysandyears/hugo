L. Sidney Lear:<br><strong>A Book Containing a Text, Short Reading and Hymn for Every Day in the Church&rsquo;s Year</strong>.</p><p>This site offers a quiet space for reflection and reading, structured around the traditional Christian calendar. Each entry corresponds to a day in the liturgical year, preserving the tone and rhythm of the original work.</p><p>The original was published in New York by E. P. Dutton, 1879.</p><p>This project is a labor of love — part preservation, part prayerbook.</p><p>Best viewed using e-ink (What isn&rsquo;t?) or on the command line or Emacs or something textually.</p><p>As a cheat you can do something like hg/days/2025-01-04/ to skip about the pages. As most of this project is manual entry most of the dates are empty so far.</p><p>I think this will eventually become a simple phone app that displays a day by day calendar and that is all. No settings, no distrations, just a full screen Calendar type thing.</p><hr><p><em>“For signs and for seasons, and for days and years.”</em> : Genesis 1:14</p><p>Hosted on @ <a href=https://fordaysandyears.github.io/hg/>https://fordaysandyears.github.io/hg/</a></p><footer><br><br><br><br><p align=right><a href=https://fordaysandyears.world/about/ style=font-size:8px>about</a></p></footer></main></div></body></html>
